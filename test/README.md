These are test files for the cosmac assembler.

They confirm that the test source build has not changed as the assembler evolves.

Run the test script `test.sh`  from this directory.


The 'reference' folder holds "known good" assembler output files. These are compared to the latest assembler output.
These files should be updated as needed when *valid* changes to the assembler occur.
